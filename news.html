                            ON-A Architecture Studio has designed a proposal to cover the FC Barcelona football stadium with a rooftop park in Spain. Converting the stadium into a 26-hectare park, the project aims to re-nature the stadium's surrounding area. Called Nou Parc, the design features a new topography that would also create a forest for the city of Barcelona.

							As ON-A outlines, Barcelona currently has just over 6sqm of green areas per inhabitant. According to the World Health Organization, cities should have a minimum of 9sqm. The proposal for the Nou Parc ​​aims to turn the area into a great green lung using bio-architecture as a strategy for re-naturating. The design would reform one of the most significant locations in the city of Barcelona, the Camp Nou, creating a blanket of green forest that would place facilities attached to the stadium below the surface of the new park. The resulting new topography would hide the services linked to the stadium, and in turn, the stadium would function independently of the park.                        </p>

                            Suburbs as we know them are changing forever. Partially exacerbated by the effects of the pandemic, residents are leaving cities in droves in search of more favorable living conditions where more space, privacy, and affordability offers what some consider to be a more comfortable lifestyle. But as time goes on, and development sprawls, it’s harder to tell where cities end and suburbs begin.
                        </p>
                        <p class="font-4 disp-non marg-50b" id="readMore3">
                            

    What was once seen as a slower way of life is seeing new developments and mixed-use centers that rethink density, walkability, sustainable impact, and diversity- all critical factors that are considered when planning some of the largest and most dense urban cores in the world. In 30 years will there even be such a thing as a suburb anymore? Or will these areas find a way to redevelop their own to become an extension of a city?

    It’s first important to define what these suburbs are- not just “city adjacents” like the conglomerate of urban centers located in the Bay Area in California, but more stand-alone cities that have long been associated with urban sprawl and the reliance on automobiles and the dominance of low-rise, low-density, single-use, private buildings that characterizes them. While for many years, there were distinct architectural markers that clearly delineated what was urban and what was suburban, that boundary has begun to blur, making the city outskirts feel not so different than the cities themselves.

                            MAD Architects has just unveiled its design for the “Train Station in the Forest.” Under construction and scheduled for completion by July 1st, 2021, the project is located in the center of Jiaxing, in southeast China, in close proximity to Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Suzhou. Covering an area of 35.4 hectares, the intervention consists of rebuilding the historic station while creating a new infrastructural annex underground. It also includes the creation of plazas to the north and south and the rehabilitation of the adjacent People’s Park.

                        <p class="font-4 disp-non marg-50b" id="readMore2">
                            Led by Ma Yansong, MAD Architects drew inspiration from the city’s historic and cultural contexts. Efficient, human-scaled, and abundant with natural light, the new station will generate a comfortable environment. While the main transportation and commercial functions are to be located in the basement level, the ground-floor space will be given back to nature, freed from any infrastructure, creating thus a “train station in the forest”, and allowing “the People’s Park to radiate through the scheme into the city, and form an urban oasis”. In fact, the project seeks to put in place a “borderless park” where citizens and travelers can dwell and enjoy the beautiful natural environment, bringing the city center back to the people.                        </p>
